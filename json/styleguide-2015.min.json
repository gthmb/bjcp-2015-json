Simply because this is how IPA was shipped, doesn’t mean thatother beers such as Porter weren’t also sent to India, that IPA wasinvented to be sent to India, that IPA was more heavily hopped thanother keeping beers, or that the alcohol level was unusual for thetime. Many modern examples labeled IPA are quite weak in strength.According to CAMRA, “so-called IPAs with strengths of around 3.5% arenot true to style.” English beer historian Martyn Cornell hascommented that beers like this are “not really distinguishable from anordinary bitter.” So we choose to agree with these sources for ourguidelines rather than what some modern British breweries are callingan IPA; just be aware of these two main types of IPAs in the Britishmarket today.","history":"Accounts of its origins vary, but most agree that what became laterknown as IPA was pale ale prepared for shipment to India in the late1700s and early 1800s.

As with allEnglish beers with a long history, the popularity and formulation ofthe product changed over time. Burton breweries with theirhigh-sulfate water were able to successfully brew IPA and began theirdomination of this market by the 1830s, around the time the name IndiaPale Ale was first used. Strength and popularity declined over time,and the style virtually disappeared in the second half of the 20thcentury.

The beer was racked into barrels while activelyfermenting &#40;1.020 - 1.022&#41; and tightly bunged to allow carbonation inthe saloon cellar. There is some speculation that it was a variant ofthe lighter common or cream ale produced throughout much of the Eastprior to the Civil War and that the darker grains were added by themostly Germanic brewers to help acidify the typical carbonate water ofthe Louisville area, or that they had a preference for darker coloredbeers. Up until the late 19th century, Kentucky Common was not brewedin the summer months unless cellars, usually used for malting, wereused for fermentation. With the advent of ice machines, the largerbreweries were able to brew year round. In the period from 1900 toprohibition, about 75% of the beer sold in the Louisville area wasKentucky Common. With prohibition, the style died completely as thefew larger breweries that survived were almost exclusively lagerproducers.","ingredients":"Six-row barley malt was used with 35% corn grits to dilute theexcessive protein levels along with 1 to 2% each caramel and blackmalt.
